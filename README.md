# IIITD Feedback Form Autofiller

**UPDATE Nov 2025: see the last commit for Opine forms. IIITD has shifted to a new platform, Nurecampus. But they still can't stop me, MWAHAHAHA**

Le steps:

1. Open form in browser

2. Right click and go to "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"

3. Go to console

4. Copy and paste the contents of `fill.js` into the console.


5. And voila! The first option for every non-text question will be clicked. You can now scroll down and save, or change answers if you want. 

just a proof of concept, i totally didn't use it or anything :o
